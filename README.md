### Purpose

I didn't look too long, but couldn't find a tool to graph out Windows parent and children processes. So wrote this quick Shiny app to do so.

### Install and use

```
install.packages("remotes") # Run this if you don't have the remotes package
remotes::install_github("chasemc/processView")

# And, to run the app:
processView::run_app()

```
